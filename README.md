This repository contains some documentation files for the nX-U8/100 core and some other documents relating to Casio calculator hacking in general. 

Note that the translated Oki Technical Review PDFs (`202_R25_en.pdf` and `203_R06_en.pdf`) will appear broken because font embedding was disabled during editing, and it isn't easy to embed fonts into existing text.
The fonts needed to render the text correctly are stored in the `oki_review_fonts` folder.

`研究报告.pdf` and `研究报告_en.pdf` are the 2012 fx-ES PLUS series research report document by yls_1996 on the Baidu Tieba fx-es(ms) bar. Note that the English translated version (`研究报告_en.pdf`) only has the first 7 pages translated.
