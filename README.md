This repository contains some documentation files for the nX-U8/100 core.

Note that the translated Oki Technical Review PDFs (`202_R25_en.pdf` and `203_R06_en.pdf`) will appear broken because font embedding was disabled during editing, and it isn't easy to embed fonts into existing text.
The fonts needed to render the text correctly are stored in the `oki_review_fonts` folder.
